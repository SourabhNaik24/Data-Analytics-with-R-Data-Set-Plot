# Data-Analytics-with-R-Data-Set-Plot

R System:
R has extensive and powerful graphics abilities, that are tightly linked with its analytic abilities. The R system is developing rapidly. New features and abilities appear every few months.   Simple calculations and analyses can be handled straightforwardly.  Chapters 1 and 2 indicate the range of abilities that are immediately available to novice users.  If simple methods prove inadequate, there can be recourse to the huge range of more advanced abilities that R offers.  Adaptation of available abilities allows even greater flexibility.  The R community is widely drawn, from application area specialists as well as statistical specialists. It is a community that is sensitive to the potential for misuse of statistical techniques and suspicious of what might appear to be mindless use. Expect scepticism of the use of models that are not susceptible to some minimal form of data-based validation. Because R is free, users have no right to expect attention, on the R-help list or elsewhere, to queries.  Be grateful for whatever help is given. 

Data Analytics:
Data analytics refers to qualitative and quantitative techniques and processes used to enhance productivity and business gain. Data is extracted and categorized to identify and analyze behavioral data and patterns, and techniques vary according to organizational requirements.
